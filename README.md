A Power Factor Converter (PFC) is a power electronic circuit used to improve the power factor of an AC supply by shaping the input current to be in phase with the input voltage. This reduces reactive power, improves efficiency, and minimizes losses in the power system.
Power Factor Correction is widely used in SMPS, motor drives, chargers, and industrial power supplies.
